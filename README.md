# BoundedCoalescent

BoundedCoalescent is a R package to simulate and compute the probability
of phylogenies under the bounded coalescent model. This model is
obtained by conditioning the standard coalescent so that the most recent
ancestor of the whole sample occurs after a set date.

## Installation

You can install BoundedCoalescent from github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("DrJCarson/BoundedCoalescent")
```

The package can then be loaded using:

``` r
library(BoundedCoalescent)
```
